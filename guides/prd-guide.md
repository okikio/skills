> **Current standards note (2026-08-19):** Use [Okikio Engineering Standards](./engineering-standards.md) for current cross-project naming, schema/type, comments/TSDoc, formatting, testing, logging, dependency, compatibility, validation, and delivery rules. This document remains authoritative for its domain-specific design and dated implementation evidence where it is more specific.

A good PRD is a **decision document**, not a requirements landfill.

It should make the team confident about **why this product change matters, who it is for, what must be true when it ships, what is intentionally out of scope, and how success will be judged**. Atlassian frames a PRD as defining a product’s purpose, features, and behavior so stakeholders and development teams align around what is being built. Aha similarly describes it as communicating what you are building, who it is for, and how it delivers customer and business value. ([atlassian.com][1])

## The real purpose of a PRD

A PRD exists to prevent five expensive failures:

1. **Building the wrong thing**
2. **Solving a vague problem**
3. **Letting every stakeholder imagine a different product**
4. **Shipping without knowing what “done” means**
5. **Discovering risks too late**

The best PRDs do not just say, “Build X.” They explain the path from **problem → user pain → business reason → product behavior → acceptance criteria → risks → rollout**.

SVPG makes an important distinction here: documentation is not a substitute for product discovery. A PRD is useful after enough discovery has happened to make the team believe the opportunity and solution are worth pursuing. Otherwise, the document becomes a polished guess. ([Silicon Valley Product Group][2])

## The anatomy of a good PRD

A strong PRD usually answers these questions:

### 1. What problem are we solving?

This is the anchor. Without it, every later requirement becomes arbitrary.

Bad:

> Add CSV export.

Good:

> Customers managing large account lists need to reconcile usage data with internal billing systems. Today they copy data manually from the dashboard, which is slow, error-prone, and blocks monthly reporting.

The second version tells engineering and design what outcome matters, not just what UI button to add.

### 2. Who is it for?

A good PRD names the actual user or buyer, and ideally distinguishes them.

For example:

* **Primary user:** billing operations manager
* **Secondary user:** account admin
* **Buyer/stakeholder:** finance lead
* **Internal user:** support team investigating billing disputes

This matters because the “right” product changes depending on who is actually suffering.

### 3. Why now?

This is where the PRD connects product work to strategy.

Good reasons include revenue, retention, activation, support cost, compliance, competitive pressure, infrastructure unlocks, or a major customer commitment. Weak PRDs often skip this and assume the feature’s importance is self-evident.

### 4. What should the product do?

This is the functional core, but it should be written as observable behavior, not vague intention.

Bad:

> The system should support exports.

Good:

> An account admin can export usage records for a selected billing period as CSV. The export includes account ID, customer name, metered event type, quantity, timestamp range, and invoice status. The export excludes deleted test accounts by default.

This gives engineers something testable.

### 5. What is out of scope?

This is one of the most underrated parts of a PRD.

A PRD without non-goals invites scope creep. For example:

> Out of scope: scheduled recurring exports, S3 delivery, custom column selection, and exports larger than 90 days of data.

That single section can save days of debate.

### 6. What does success look like?

A good PRD defines both **product success** and **delivery acceptance**.

Product success:

> 40% reduction in billing-related support tickets within 60 days.

Delivery acceptance:

> Given an admin selects March 2026, when they click Export CSV, then the system generates a downloadable CSV containing all billable usage events for that period within 30 seconds for accounts under 100k events.

Acceptance criteria matter because they eliminate ambiguity around what must be true before work is accepted. Atlassian describes acceptance criteria as predefined conditions a task or product must meet to be considered complete. ([atlassian.com][3])

## The risk section is where good PRDs become great

A mediocre PRD describes the happy path. A good PRD names the risks.

SVPG’s “four risks” are a useful lens:

| Risk        | Question the PRD should answer                                         |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Value       | Will users actually care?                                              |
| Usability   | Can users understand and use it?                                       |
| Feasibility | Can we build it with our current technical constraints?                |
| Viability   | Does it work for the business, legal, pricing, support, and GTM model? |

SVPG explicitly calls out these risk categories, including business viability concerns such as go-to-market fit, monetization, partner constraints, compliance, and brand consistency. ([Silicon Valley Product Group][4])

For a technical product, this section should be concrete:

* Rate limits
* Data freshness
* Latency targets
* Security/privacy constraints
* Migration risks
* Backward compatibility
* Observability needs
* Failure modes
* Billing or metering implications
* API versioning implications

## The best PRDs preserve judgment

A bad PRD tries to eliminate thinking:

> Build this exact thing exactly this way.

A good PRD focuses judgment:

> Here is the problem, the user, the constraints, the success bar, the known risks, and the decisions already made. Within that frame, design and engineering should still improve the solution.

That distinction matters. A PRD should align the team, not handcuff them.

## My practical checklist

A PRD is good when a smart engineer, designer, PM, support lead, and founder can each read it and independently answer:

* What problem are we solving?
* Why does this matter now?
* Who is the user?
* What must the product do?
* What must it not do?
* What assumptions are we making?
* What risks could invalidate this?
* What are the acceptance criteria?
* How will we measure success?
* What decisions are already made?
* What decisions are still open?

If those answers are clear, the PRD is doing its job.

## The simplest mental model

Think of a PRD like a bridge.

On one side: **messy reality**: user pain, business goals, constraints, politics, edge cases, risks.

On the other side: **buildable work**: flows, requirements, acceptance criteria, implementation planning, QA, launch.

A good PRD is the bridge between them. It does not need to be long. It needs to make the right things impossible to misunderstand.
