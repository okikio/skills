description: Design, implement, refactor, review, diagnose, test, package, or release command-line applications. Use for command grammar, flags, configuration, environment sources, results and diagnostics, prompts, errors, cancellation, completion, manuals, installed artifacts, or CLI libraries, especially with Optique, LogTape, c12, defu, Standard Schema, Zod, Deno, and focused UnJS packages. Do not use for a shell one-liner or incidental script with no CLI product contract.

# Build command-line applications

`deliver-software` owns request authority and repository completion.
`deno-software` owns Deno manifests, tasks, permissions, compilation, and
publication. `explore-ecosystems` owns dependency topology. `build-libraries`
owns reusable programming models extracted from or consumed by the CLI. This
skill owns the CLI's public language and operational contract.

## Evidence preflight

Before changing a public CLI surface, inspect:

- nearest manifests, lockfiles, executable entrypoints, and command registry;
- tasks, permission sets, generated commands, and installed entrypoints;
- parsers, source contexts, schemas, normalization, and defaults;
- configuration discovery, precedence, provenance, and dynamic factories;
- result and diagnostic routing, renderers, redaction, and sink lifecycle;
- signal ownership, subprocesses, workers, browsers, cleanup, and exit mapping;
- help, completion, manuals, docs, examples, package contents, and acceptance
  tests.

Separate intended architecture, observed implementation, documented behavior,
and behavior actually executed. A guidebook is not proof that the repository
implements its contract.

## Public-surface trace

Classify each public term as an early control, source-bearing configuration, or
domain request input. These roles can overlap: a diagnostic or output control
may be read early for bootstrap behavior and still participate in final source
precedence. Help, version, and completion bootstrap must work before project
configuration is valid. Terms that are source-bearing traverse configuration
precedence; purely early controls and domain inputs do not automatically do so.

Trace each applicable flag, argument, environment variable, config field,
output, or error through:

```text
public name
  -> parser term
  -> sparse source value
  -> schema validation
  -> precedence and normalization
  -> handler request
  -> downstream consumer
  -> help, completion, man, and docs
  -> executable tests
```

If an arrow is missing, treat it as a defect or unresolved contract. Do not
invent the connection.

## Keep parsing, resolution, and execution separate

A parser interprets one supplied representation. A resolver decides which independently supplied value wins. Execution owns live resources, effects, cancellation, and disposal.

```text
argv or other representation -> parser -> sparse values
config/env/programmatic layers -> resolver -> runtime request
runtime request -> execution -> live resources and effects
```

Do not make a parser load environment variables, config files, prompts, secret stores, or runtime resources merely because those values eventually affect the same command. Do not encode missing, deferred, or pending control state as a fake domain value.

## Core rules

1. Keep handlers portable where reuse or testing justifies it. Inject process,
   terminal, filesystem, clock, environment, signal, and network capabilities.
2. Prevent structurally invalid command forms in the parser where practical.
   Validate merged-source and domain semantics in runtime schemas.
3. Preserve sparse source patches. Apply defaults after precedence resolution.
4. Give every configuration source one owner and define precedence, object,
   array, union, and operation semantics explicitly.
5. Route stable results and operational diagnostics separately. Apply any
   route-specific structured redaction policy before serialization. Durable
   artifacts belong to their storage owner.
6. Make prompting automation-safe. A non-interactive process must never hang.
7. Install cancellation at the composition root, propagate one signal tree,
   bound cleanup, and map signals to stable outcomes.
8. Give public error rendering one owner and failures stable exit classes.
9. Verify the installed or compiled artifact, not only in-process functions.
10. Preserve authored Markdown layout. Never run a broad formatter over CLI
    guidebooks, tables, or manuals unless the user explicitly requests it.

## LogTape and formatter policy

When the repository already uses LogTape, preserve it as the structured
observability transport. Libraries emit records; the executable configures
routes, sinks, filters, formatters, and redaction. Keep a project formatter when
it communicates the domain better than `@logtape/pretty`; ecosystem conformity
is not a reason to replace a working compact formatter.

Use `@optique/logtape` for logging grammar and configuration where its contract
matches the CLI. Audit `@logtape/redaction` against real fields before enabling
it broadly. Preserve successful records, use rate controls and lazy expensive
properties for noisy hot paths, and use `@logtape/testing` for logger behavior.
Keep result/diagnostic writers runtime-neutral when the CLI's reusable core can
run outside Deno.

## Production stack doctrine

When a CLI uses Optique, c12, defu, LogTape, and Zod together, assign one owner
per responsibility:

| Responsibility | Owner | Failure to reject |
|---|---|---|
| Token grammar, choices, aliases, suggestions, completion, and manuals | Optique | Handwritten help or post-parse boolean reconciliation |
| Help-only default visibility | Optique document metadata | Parser defaults that materialize sparse source values |
| Project config discovery, formats, `extends`, env branches, and factories | c12 | Strict runtime validation before loader metadata is consumed |
| Recursive merge mechanics | defu behind an app merger | Public `defu(cli, env, file)` with accidental array concatenation |
| Runtime defaults, transforms, and external data contracts | Zod or another schema adapter | Defaults on sparse authoring or CLI patch schemas |
| Results, diagnostics, bootstrap errors, redaction, and sink lifecycle | LogTape at the executable composition root | `console.*`, duplicate loggers, or library-owned sink setup |

Optique is the CLI grammar owner only when the repository deliberately selects it. Verify the installed stable package line and its exports before using version-specific features. Do not make Optique a universal dependency for reusable libraries or for a project that deliberately owns its own parser. For example, a native-parser project can keep Optique as a compatibility adapter, reference implementation, or conformance oracle instead of its runtime parser.

When the installed Optique line provides them, use native features such as `negatableFlag()` for tri-state Boolean overrides, `choice()` for schema-backed enumerations, `deferredValue()` only for handler-time fallback functions, and `runProgram()` hooks for per-command resources such as one resolved config snapshot and logger. Do not use `deferredValue()` as a replacement for ordinary schema defaults.

The defaulting rule is strict: authored config, environment, and CLI patches
stay sparse; documented defaults can appear in help; executable defaults apply
once in the complete runtime schema. Zod `.default()` is for already-valid
output defaults, `.prefault()` is for fallbacks that must pass through
transforms, and `.catch()` is error recovery rather than normal configuration.
`@optique/zod` adapts one CLI value to Zod validation; it does not transfer
multi-source precedence or runtime-default ownership to Optique.

Record provenance while resolving source layers. Do not reconstruct it from the
final value: an explicit CLI value can equal the inherited config value and must
still remain the winner. Version and redact the provenance envelope before
rendering it or passing it through LogTape.

Load dynamic project configuration once per invocation. If Optique source
contexts need a c12 snapshot and the handler also needs final config, thread
that snapshot through `runProgram()` hooks or an equivalent composition-root
resource. Do not let handlers call the full resolver again.

## Completion gate

Do not call CLI work complete until the real invocation path has been exercised
for success, invalid input, operational failure, and cancellation as applicable;
stdout, stderr, exit status, and artifacts match their contracts; generated
surfaces agree; and the packaged or compiled entrypoint runs in a clean context.
Report blocked checks separately from failed checks. If the change makes a
performance claim, run a named representative benchmark against a recorded
baseline and report absolute change, relative change, variability, and semantic
oracles.
