# Build durable workflows and pipelines

Durability is a recovery property, not a naming convention. Start from the state
that must survive process loss, then design execution, queues, effects, leases,
checkpoints, timers, signals, and operator recovery around that authority.

`build-data` owns storage engines and artifact formats. `build-apis` owns public
HTTP exposure. `build-libraries` owns reusable restart/checkpoint contracts that
do not themselves provide durable orchestration. `deliver-software` owns the
final completion verdict.

## Outcome

A durable workflow should have a traceable execution model:

```text
trigger / command
      |
      v
durable run identity
      |
      v
persisted state/history
      |
      +--> queue / timer / signal / wait
      |
      v
claimed attempt with lease/fence
      |
      v
activity / external effect
      |
      v
atomic result/checkpoint publication
      |
      +--> retry / compensation / reconciliation
      |
      v
terminal state + operator evidence
```

A table, workflow definition, or queue consumer stub is not proof that the path
is reachable or survives interruption.

## Durability evidence ladder

Classify each claimed capability independently:

1. workflow/definition authored;
2. registered/discoverable by the runtime;
3. runtime adapter implemented rather than stubbed;
4. actual execution process/work unit boots and is reachable;
5. durable run/history/projection persists;
6. queue, timer, wait, signal, cancellation, and retry paths exist as required;
7. restart/replay/resume behavior is tested;
8. operator inspection, repair, retry, cancel, and reconciliation exist;
9. API/CLI/application reaches the durable path;
10. deployment/upgrade behavior is proven for the claimed topology.

Do not collapse these into one “workflow exists” boolean.

## Identity and authority preflight

For every workflow, define:

- logical workflow/run ID;
- attempt ID and retry semantics;
- task/job/message/event identity;
- external-effect idempotency key;
- authoritative durable state/history;
- sequence/version/fencing value used to reject stale work;
- completion criteria and terminal-state owner;
- checkpoint identity and the outputs it proves durable;
- trigger dedupe/concurrency/singleton policy;
- retention and replay window;
- operator-visible audit information.

Name the actual execution resource. Do not use `worker` as a generic word for a
process, thread, browser context, async task, queue claim, or lease holder.

## Procedure

1. **Separate transient control from durable authority.** `AbortSignal`, local
   promises, in-memory observables, and process-local queues coordinate active
   work but do not survive process loss.
2. **Choose the runtime from requirements.** Timers, long sleeps, signals,
   replay, throughput, latency, versioning, operational cost, deployment, and
   language/runtime constraints decide whether Temporal, Effect Workflow, a
   database control plane, or another owner fits. Do not select by familiarity.
3. **Keep replay deterministic.** Orchestration code that may replay cannot read
   ambient time/random/network/filesystem/process state directly. Isolate
   nondeterministic I/O in activities/effects or recorded commands according to
   the engine contract.
4. **Make retryable effects safe.** External writes are at-least-once unless a
   stronger guarantee is actually proven. Use provider idempotency, transactional
   dedupe/inbox/outbox, compare-and-set, unique constraints, or reconciliation.
5. **Make claims stale-safe.** Leases need expiry plus a fencing/version token so
   an old execution cannot commit after a new claimant has taken ownership.
6. **Commit checkpoints after durable outputs.** A checkpoint means the outputs
   it references are committed and replay-safe. Do not advance progress before
   a required sink/artifact is durable.
7. **Treat cross-system writes as sagas unless one transaction covers them.**
   Define compensation, reconciliation, retry, and operator state for the gap.
8. **Bound work.** Queue depth, concurrency, batch size, open resources, retry
   attempts, backoff, timers, buffered events, and cleanup all need limits or
   admission rules.
9. **Define cancellation semantics.** Distinguish cancel request, cooperative
   stop, cleanup/disposal, compensation, terminal canceled state, and late result
   rejection.
10. **Design operator recovery.** Inspection, retry, resume, replay, quarantine,
    dead-letter/poison handling, manual override, and audit must use the same
    durable authority as automatic execution.
11. **Document internal workflow invariants.** Sequence numbers, lease/fence
    rules, checkpoint ordering, cancellation transitions, timer semantics,
    replay restrictions, and repair algorithms deserve comments/TSDoc even when
    not exported.

## Pipeline rules

For multi-stage ingestion or ETL:

- preserve source provenance and immutable/raw evidence where required;
- distinguish stage attempt from logical batch/run;
- publish artifacts atomically through manifests or equivalent commit records;
- keep required sinks incomplete until their receipts/reconciliation succeed;
- bound batching/memory/concurrency;
- make resume choose committed work, not “last line printed”;
- classify partial results by sink/stage rather than one global success flag;
- preserve enough identity to rerun one failed projection without replaying
  unrelated committed work.

## Failure and recovery drills

Deliberately test:

- process loss before/after each durable write;
- duplicate trigger or queue delivery;
- two concurrent claims of the same work;
- lease expiry while the old claimant later returns;
- external effect succeeds but local commit fails;
- local state commits but downstream provider fails;
- poison input and retry exhaustion;
- queue backlog/rate-limit pressure;
- cancellation during an activity and during checkpoint publication;
- replay after code/version change;
- worker/runtime restart;
- partial sink failure and targeted reconciliation;
- operator retry/resume/repair path.

A happy-path retry unit test does not prove durability.

## Verification ladder

1. deterministic state-transition/unit tests;
2. store/queue/timer/lease integration tests;
3. duplicate/concurrency/idempotency tests;
4. failpoints around every important commit pair;
5. actual execution process restart/recovery;
6. replay/versioning tests when the runtime replays code;
7. public API/CLI reachability;
8. operator recovery drill;
9. deployment/runtime health and shutdown when claimed.

## Completion gate

Do not claim durability until an interruption and restart have executed against
the real persistence and execution path, stale/duplicate work cannot corrupt the
result, required cross-system gaps have reconciliation, cancellation and cleanup
are coherent, and an operator can inspect and repair the run. Clearly separate
unimplemented adapters, blocked runtime tests, and aspirational design from
verified behavior.
