# Delivery Workflow

Use these rules for delivery agents, reusable research notes, and repo-local
automation scripts.

## Search and research order

When researching or searching, prefer this order unless the task clearly
requires something else:

1. the repository's established research cache, when one exists
2. applicable instruction files, including `.github/instructions/`
3. the rest of the codebase

Search local code and reusable notes before inventing new code or repeating
external research.

When the repository already uses `.agents/research/`, store a reviewable note
there only when external research produced a durable, non-obvious conclusion
that future work is likely to reuse. Do not create bookkeeping directories or
research files merely because this reference mentions them.

Keep research notes reusable, but do not compress away the details that
motivated the search.

Research notes should preserve exact details when they matter, such as:

- specific API names or method names
- deprecated symbols and their replacements
- exact commands, flags, or invocation shapes
- version-sensitive behavior
- subtle caveats, exceptions, or migration notes
- the source that established the conclusion

Prefer compact notes over raw transcripts, but do not shrink away the evidence a
later agent would need to act correctly.

## Reuse before invention

Before introducing custom implementation work:

- search the codebase for existing patterns, helpers, and abstractions
- check whether a maintained package already solves the problem
- use current documentation when library or framework APIs may already cover the
  need

Prefer evidence of reuse checks before approving hand-rolled solutions.

## Tool priority

Prefer workspace read, search, symbol, and edit tools first.

Use the terminal mainly for:

- verification
- tests
- benchmarks
- typechecks
- lint
- running scripts

Do not default to terminal-driven exploration when workspace tools can do the
job more directly.

## Script policy

For repetitive bulk edits or other writing-oriented automation, prefer a
reviewable script in the repository's established automation location. Use Deno
and TypeScript when they fit the repository; do not introduce Deno into an
unrelated project solely for a temporary edit.

Feel free to use `jsr:` and `npm:` packages when they improve clarity, safety,
or reviewability.

Prefer `jsr:@std/*` modules when they fit the task, especially for:

- filesystem work
- encodings
- buffers
- collections
- paths
- related standard utilities

Keep scripts narrow and task-specific.

## Validation and verification bar

Validation is about the changed surface being internally sound. Verification is
about the real deliverable actually working.

Plan completion is separate from deliverable completion.

A task is not fully done unless you complete both checklists in order.

1. Deliverable checklist

- zero TypeScript issues in the changed surface
- no deprecated APIs left behind
- no stale Zod usage when current APIs should be used
- schemas treated as the source of truth when they define the contract
- the real deliverable is complete and verified

2. Plan checklist

- all intended deliverables were identified, tracked, and reviewed against the
  original goals, requirements, and intent
- the full plan coverage is complete and reviewed

Do not stop at tests, benchmarks, or lint when the real deliverable can be run
directly.

For runnable deliverables such as CLIs, jobs, migrations, generators, servers,
or user-facing workflows, run the actual capability whenever possible.

Verification is binary at the end: either the capability works and is proven, or
the task is blocked.

If the capability cannot run because of missing environment, credentials, or
infrastructure, report the exact blocker and remaining verification steps. Write
a repository progress note only when the repository already uses that mechanism
or the user requests a durable handoff.

Plan completion is also binary at the end: either the plan coverage is complete
and reviewed, or the task is blocked.

## Progress notes

You may use the repository's established progress mechanism for long-running
work, but progress notes are bookkeeping only. They never replace completion.
