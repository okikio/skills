## Ownership rules

Choose the asset integration where the renderer owns the output:

| Rendering context | Icon owner | Font owner |
|---|---|---|
| Astro static component | Astro Icon or local SVG/Astro component | Astro Fonts API/local provider |
| Solid island/application | Unplugin Icons with Solid compiler | app-root Fontsource import or inherited site font CSS |
| React island/application | Unplugin Icons with compatible JSX/React compiler | app-root Fontsource/framework font owner |
| framework-neutral package | icon component contract or raw reviewed SVG data | no global font import; expose tokens/document requirements |

One visual system may use the same Fluent collection across Astro and Solid while using different renderers. Do not make a framework island responsible for an otherwise static icon. Do not import fonts inside reusable leaf components.

When `build-sites` is active, load its `icons.md` and `fonts.md` for the complete Astro-specific configuration, provider, preload, fallback, accessibility, and verification rules.

## Icon contract

Record:

- collection and style family (for example Fluent Regular);
- server/client renderer and compiler;
- literal import or reviewed registry;
- dimensions and viewBox;
- current-color fill/stroke policy;
- decorative versus informative semantics;
- local SVG provenance, sanitization, and license;
- allowed names for dynamic selection;
- bundle inclusion mechanism.

An icon-only button gets its accessible name from the button. Decorative SVGs remain hidden. An informative SVG needs a verified title/description relationship. Do not infer accessibility from a `title` prop.

## Font contract

Record:

- family role and CSS token;
- provider/source, version, license, and privacy policy;
- exact weights/styles/subsets/variable axes;
- self-hosted asset/caching owner;
- fallback sequence and metric adjustment;
- `font-display` and preload policy;
- first-paint routes using each face;
- language/glyph coverage;
- layout-shift and visual-regression evidence.

Avoid duplicate owners such as an Astro provider plus a Fontsource CSS import for the same family. Preload only exact first-paint faces. A configured variable weight range must match the file's axes.

## Component-library integration

Open-code component registries such as shadcn/Zaidan can carry icons and font classes from a different renderer or design system. After generation:

1. replace renderer-incompatible icon imports;
2. preserve accessible names and focus behavior;
3. map size/color classes to local tokens;
4. remove package-wide font assumptions;
5. verify SSR and hydration;
6. keep generator provenance so future updates can be reconciled.

Do not mix Lucide, Fluent, local filled icons, and text glyphs within one surface accidentally. A deliberate exception should document why the primary collection lacks the needed shape.

## Verification

```bash
rg -n 'astro-icon|unplugin-icons|~icons/|lucide|fontProviders|@fontsource|@font-face' \
  src astro.config.* vite.config.* package.json
```

Run the production server/client build, inspect built HTML/CSS, trace network font requests, measure critical asset sizes, test no-JS/static output, and exercise screen-reader names, keyboard focus, high contrast, reduced data, slow font loading, and mobile layout.

## Sources and freshness

- Primary: [Astro Icon](https://www.astroicon.dev/), [Unplugin Icons](https://github.com/unplugin/unplugin-icons), [Astro Fonts](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/fonts/), and [Fontsource](https://fontsource.org/docs/). Unplugin Icons was rechecked 2026-08-19 for on-demand imports, Vite/Rollup/Webpack/Nuxt/Rspack adapters, React/Solid compilers, SSR/SSG, custom collections, auto import, and TypeScript support.
- Attachments: `kaiju-site-scope(17).zip/apps/frontend`, `kaiju-site-scope(17).zip/apps/docs`, and `kaiju-website(6).zip`, inspected 2026-07-17 for cross-renderer asset ownership.

Renderer compilers, Astro APIs, and generated virtual modules are version-sensitive. This reference defines ownership; exact imports must be verified against the target framework and lockfile.
