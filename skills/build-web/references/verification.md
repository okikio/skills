# Web verification manual

Use this reference to prove a web change across build artifacts, server output, hydration, browser behavior, accessibility, security, connected systems, performance, and resource lifetime. A passing typecheck is not a browser result.

## Verification target inventory

Before running commands record:

```text
Routes changed:
Static/server/deferred output:
Renderer and island directives:
URL/query/local/session state:
Forms and mutations:
Auth/tenant boundary:
CMS/API/provider dependencies:
Assets/icons/fonts/motion:
Deployment adapter:
Browser support policy:
Expected no-JS behavior:
Authorized test targets:
```

Read repository-owned scripts and CI before inventing commands. Keep formatters scoped away from authored Markdown unless the user requests document formatting.

## Layered matrix

| Layer | What it proves | What it does not prove |
|---|---|---|
| Schema/typecheck | Static contracts and reachable type errors | Runtime DOM, CSS, network, adapter behavior |
| Unit test | Pure policy/state cases | Real framework integration unless mounted accordingly |
| Production build | Compiler, bundler, routes, adapter output | Deployed runtime and user behavior |
| Server integration | HTTP, middleware, cookies, services | Hydration, focus, layout, browser APIs |
| Hydration test | Server/client structural agreement | Full browser accessibility/performance |
| Browser test | User flows and platform behavior | All target environments unless matrixed |
| Visual inspection | Layout/aesthetic result | Semantics, auth, hidden failures |
| Deployment smoke | Host adapter and configuration | Broad regression suite |

Do not substitute a lower layer for a higher-risk claim.

## Build and artifact checks

Run each output mode the repository claims. For Astro this often includes:

```sh
pnpm astro check
pnpm build
pnpm preview
```

Use the actual package manager/scripts. Then inspect:

- route manifest and generated paths;
- prerendered versus server routes;
- server adapter output and startup entrypoint;
- OpenAPI/feed/sitemap/robots/redirect/header artifacts;
- client chunks per island and duplicate framework runtimes;
- source maps and accidental secret/environment serialization;
- icon collection and font assets;
- image dimensions/formats and static fallback assets;
- cache-busting filenames and public base paths.

A successful server build can still misclassify a route or ship an empty client-only placeholder.

## Server and hydration checks

Capture raw HTML before client JavaScript:

```sh
curl -fsS -D /tmp/headers.txt http://127.0.0.1:4321/search?q=solid > /tmp/page.html
```

Assert required headings, content, canonical metadata, form labels, fallback states, and initial styles. For personalized pages, use safe local fixtures and authorized session setup.

Hydration harness requirements:

1. Render through the actual server renderer with hydration markers enabled.
2. Execute required hydration bootstrap.
3. Hydrate the same component/route and capture `console.error`/`console.warn`.
4. Fail on hydration/mismatch diagnostics.
5. Assert initial style/DOM before hydration and interactive state after.
6. Dispose and confirm external resources stop.

Cover time/randomness, media queries, local storage, auth capability props, SVG, CSS variables, transforms, client-only fallback, and invalid HTML.

## Browser behavior

Test real sequences, not snapshots only:

- direct deep link, reload, back, forward, and copied URL;
- invalid URL values and canonical default stripping;
- initial loading, stale refresh, empty, partial, offline, retry, and fatal error;
- interaction before and during hydration;
- double click/submit, reordered async response, cancellation, and route departure;
- repeated client navigation and page initialization;
- dialogs/sheets/menus with keyboard, pointer, touch, and focus return;
- responsive overflow and orientation change;
- browser zoom/text resize;
- reduced motion and preference changes;
- no JavaScript where progressive enhancement is claimed;
- image, font, icon, canvas/WebGL, CMS/API, and auth failure.

For URL-owned filters assert that a copied link reconstructs query, filter, sort, and page. Changing a filter should reset dependent page state according to the documented policy.

## Accessibility

Automated checks are a starting point. Manually verify:

- document language, unique title, landmarks, skip link, and heading outline;
- link/button semantics and accessible names;
- keyboard order, visible focus, modal trap and return;
- native form labels, autocomplete, field hints, errors, and error summary/focus;
- live-region restraint and announcements after async updates;
- tables with captions/header associations and chart alternatives;
- image alternatives and decorative SVG/canvas removal;
- zoom/reflow, contrast, forced colors, reduced motion;
- route announcement after client-side navigation;
- virtualized content focus/accessibility behavior.

Inspect the browser accessibility tree for complex primitives and custom elements. DOM attributes alone may not reveal ElementInternals semantics.

## Security and connected systems

Exercise real boundaries:

- allowed and rejected auth states;
- cross-tenant queries and mutations;
- cookie path/domain/SameSite/Secure behavior;
- trusted and untrusted origins with credentialed CORS;
- CSRF/origin checks;
- raw/rich HTML injection;
- cache headers for public and personalized routes;
- webhook signatures, replay, idempotency, and redaction;
- CMS cache hints and invalid/provider-error records;
- OpenAPI generation from the same factories as runtime services;
- deployment headers and redirects.

Do not test production writes or shared targets without authorization. When a real target is blocked, report the exact unverified contract rather than calling the local check equivalent.

## Performance and lifetime

Record a before/after budget for:

- transferred JavaScript and CSS by route/island;
- duplicate framework/runtime packages;
- icon modules and font files/preloads;
- LCP resource priority, CLS, INP/long tasks;
- offscreen content rendering and DOM size;
- hydration time and interaction-before-hydration;
- continuous animation/frame work;
- listener, observer, timer, subscription, worker, WebGL, and retained-root counts;
- memory across repeated navigation.

Instrument lifecycle in tests:

```ts
const add = vi.spyOn(window, "addEventListener");
const remove = vi.spyOn(window, "removeEventListener");

for (let index = 0; index < 5; index += 1) {
  const dispose = mountFeature();
  dispose();
}

expect(activeListenerBalance(add, remove)).toBe(0);
```

The exact helper is project-owned. Also spy on `requestAnimationFrame`/`cancelAnimationFrame`, observers, animations, and third-party destroy calls.

When using `content-visibility: auto`, pair it with an appropriate `contain-intrinsic-size`, avoid above-fold critical content, and verify keyboard reachability across deferred sections. Treat support/fallback according to the project's browser policy.

## Visual and content verification

Use responsive screenshots when layout or styling changed. Cover at least narrow mobile, common desktop, and a stress width/content case. Inspect:

- no clipping/overlap or horizontal page scroll;
- loading/empty/error states, not only happy data;
- fixed/sticky elements and safe areas;
- focus ring and destructive/disabled/invalid states;
- font fallback before/after load;
- image/canvas fallback;
- light/dark/forced colors;
- motion at normal and reduced preferences.

For content sites verify canonical URL, title/description, social image, structured data, feed, sitemap, draft exclusion, pagination, taxonomy links, missing media, and broken internal links.

## Failure injection

At minimum inject:

| Boundary | Failure |
|---|---|
| Server data | timeout, invalid schema, 401/403/404/409/429/500 |
| Client query | offline, stale cache, reordered responses |
| Form | invalid server response, double submit, route leave |
| CMS | missing relation/media, malformed rich text, outage |
| Auth | expired session, organization switch, bad callback |
| Assets | image/font/icon load failure |
| Motion | reduced motion, background tab, cancel during exit |
| WebGL | no context, context/texture failure, resize/unmount |
| Navigation | repeated route events, back/forward, hash target |
| Deployment | missing env/binding, cold startup, wrong base URL |

The assertion must distinguish the intended safe fallback from a silent blank view.

## Evidence report

Report:

```text
Passed:
- command/test and the contract it proves

Failed:
- command/test, failure signature, likely owner

Blocked:
- exact missing authority/environment/dependency
- what remains unverified

Not run:
- deliberately out-of-scope checks

Artifacts:
- screenshots, logs, traces, bundle reports, generated output
```

Do not merge failed and blocked checks. Do not claim a deployed, cross-browser, accessibility, or performance result from source inspection alone.
