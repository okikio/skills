# Data-system failure diagnosis and recovery

Use this reference when a data system is wrong, stale, incomplete, slow, leaking scope, or unrecoverable. Diagnose the violated owner/commit contract before adding retries or another abstraction. A green typecheck or completed process is not evidence that data committed correctly.

## Triage protocol

Preserve evidence before retrying or repairing:

1. Stop destructive cleanup, compaction, retention, or automated retry if it can erase the failure.
2. Record incident time, affected tenant/range/run/change IDs, deployed versions, resolved config digest, and topology.
3. Identify the authoritative source for each disputed fact.
4. Capture manifests, checkpoints, migration history, queue/outbox state, projection receipts, relevant system tables, and redacted diagnostics.
5. Determine the last proven committed checkpoint for every required sink.
6. Classify impact: missing, duplicate, stale, extra, corrupted, unauthorized, unavailable, or slow.
7. Reproduce on a copy/fixture where possible.
8. Choose forward repair, replay, rebuild, rollback, or restore based on authority and identity evidence.
9. Reconcile after repair; do not infer success from command exit alone.

Ask three questions first:

```text
What is authoritative?
What is the last committed identity/version?
Can reapplication be proven safe?
```

If any answer is unknown, a blind retry can create more damage.

## Authority and consistency failures

| Signature | Likely cause | Inspect | Safe next step |
|---|---|---|---|
| Two stores disagree after “successful” request | direct dual write or premature success | authority transaction, outbox/change ID, sink receipts | replay durable change or targeted repair; add handoff |
| Both stores contain independent edits | dual authority | writers, timestamps/versions, conflict policy | stop one writer; resolve facts under explicit policy |
| Search grants access after membership revoke | projection used for authorization | current membership, server base filter, indexed tenant data | block through authority; delete/repair projection |
| Rebuild resurrects deleted data | source snapshot lacks tombstones/deletion record | snapshot identity, delete log, artifact retention | rebuild from a complete source snapshot including deletes |
| Projection checkpoint is ahead of data | checkpoint committed before sink | receipt/change IDs | rewind to last proven change and replay idempotently |
| Projection data is ahead of checkpoint | crash after sink write | target version/change IDs | replay and detect already-applied change |

Do not “pick the newest timestamp” unless clock ownership, ordering, and conflict semantics make that authoritative.

## Artifact and pipeline failures

| Signature | Likely cause | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| JSONL parser fails on final line | process died mid-write | discard/truncate uncommitted segment; resume committed checkpoint |
| JSONL middle line corrupt | non-atomic append or external mutation | quarantine segment; rebuild from raw authority |
| Parquet cannot open/no footer | partial file published | remove pointer/reference; rebuild temporary artifact |
| Parquet schema varies by batch | inference from observed records | declare schema and rewrite compatible artifact |
| Memory rises with input size | materialized `list(records)` or global profiling set | bounded writer/profile sketches; large-input oracle |
| Run reports complete with errors | broad catches/best-effort stages | inspect required stage/sink states; mark incomplete |
| Daily staging file contains repeated retries | date-only append target | split by run identity; dedupe using record/source version |
| Resume skips records | checkpoint represents attempted input | rewind to committed output identity |
| Resume duplicates side effects | sink lacks idempotency/version | repair duplicates and add deterministic change identity |

The retained PopModern MediaWiki pipeline catches and ignores failures in raw capture, cleaning, staging, profiling, Parquet, run state, PostgreSQL load, and metrics, yet prints completion. Its `records_for_profiling` also retains all staged records before profiling/Parquet. Use these as concrete failure signatures, not an endorsed resilience policy.

## PostgreSQL and Drizzle failures

| Signature | Likely cause | Evidence and repair |
|---|---|---|
| Migration generated but fails empty install | SQL never applied; artifact drift | apply full committed history to disposable DB; repair migration |
| Upgrade fails while empty install passes | data/backfill/lock assumption | restore representative prior snapshot; forward repair |
| Composite foreign key creation fails | referenced key is not an appropriate unique constraint | inspect `pg_constraint`; define named `UNIQUE` key |
| Follow-up migration recreates index/constraint | duplicate schema declarations or snapshot drift | compare Drizzle schema, snapshot, journal, introspection |
| Duplicate idempotent rows under concurrency | read-then-insert | unique constraint plus atomic insert/conflict policy |
| Timeline/sequence collisions | `existing.length + 1` | database-owned atomic allocation/lock/constraint |
| Queue item claimed twice | select-then-update claim window | atomic claim/conditional update test or `SKIP LOCKED` design |
| Process/test hangs | pool handle hidden/not closed | expose client close; drain and open-handle test |
| Raw SQL error reaches API | driver error leaked | stable constraint/code mapping and redacted diagnostics |
| Imports fail without env | module-scope config/client construction | lazy factory and import-safe schema |

Before retrying deadlocks or serialization failures, ensure the whole transaction is safe to replay and bound attempts. Never retry uniqueness/check violations as transient errors.

## Search, graph, and ClickHouse failures

| Signature | Likely cause | Evidence and repair |
|---|---|---|
| Search count is low after successful bulk call | per-document failures ignored | parse batch response, list rejected IDs, replay targeted records |
| Old field behavior after schema change | in-place collection incompatible or stale alias | inspect active collection/alias and schema version; rebuild/cut over |
| Deleted document remains | upsert-only projection | tombstone/delete feed or authoritative identity reconciliation |
| RDF query returns old and new values | append added correction but did not remove old triple | rebuild/replace graph or supported delete/update |
| Graph queries hit unexpected engine | docs/deployment drift | process/container/config/endpoint evidence |
| QLever index start fails | incomplete inputs/index artifacts or config mismatch | validate input manifest; rebuild named index, never route partial |
| ClickHouse duplicates appear | MergeTree semantics or retry dedupe misunderstood | inspect table engine/order/version, parts/merges; reconcile versions |
| ClickHouse mutation appears stuck | asynchronous mutation/part rewrite | inspect `system.mutations`, part errors, resource pressure |
| Analytics misses late records | window/backfill/checkpoint policy incomplete | replay affected range and define late-arrival reconciliation |

Do not apply PostgreSQL update/uniqueness expectations to ClickHouse. Do not infer graph update capability from SPARQL query support.

## Query failures

| Signature | Likely cause | Inspect/correct |
|---|---|---|
| Cross-tenant results | missing server base predicate or graph scope escape | generated SQL/SPARQL and adversarial two-tenant fixture |
| Cursor repeats/skips | unstable order, wrong direction, mutable tiebreaker | compound cursor predicate and concurrent traversal |
| Cursor valid on unrelated filter | token lacks resource/filter/version binding | signed context digest and rejection |
| Exact total differs from rows | count/page predicates or snapshot differ | compile same authority/user filters and name consistency |
| Slow query after typed refactor | cast/expression prevents index pruning | real plan with representative values/data |
| SPARQL syntax/injection defect | raw expression/value concatenation | inspected term serializer, malicious literal tests |
| `IN []` returns surprising result | empty-list semantics undefined | reject or compile explicit true/false policy |
| New database field becomes public | wildcard not registry-bound | explicit public selection registry |

Capture generated query and bound parameters safely. Never paste secrets or personal literal values into incident reports.

## Resource and operational failures

| Signature | Likely cause | Correction |
|---|---|---|
| Pool exhaustion | per-request construction, leaked transactions, wrong replica budget | acquisition metrics, stack/call-site audit, composition-root resource |
| Shutdown hangs | intake continues or driver close unreachable | stop intake, cancel/drain bounded work, close handle |
| Retry storm | unbounded retry without jitter/budget | central retry policy, circuit/load shedding, durable retry state |
| Disk full leaves “complete” artifact | publication not atomic/manifests premature | keep incomplete manifest, reclaim safe temp files, rebuild |
| Backfill overloads production | no rate/resource isolation | bounded batches, throttling, replica/maintenance plan |
| Health passes while migrations missing | health only checks process/socket | readiness includes schema/capability compatibility |

## Recovery decision model

Choose the smallest repair with complete evidence:

| Condition | Prefer |
|---|---|
| Immutable authoritative input and deterministic projector | replay affected identities/range |
| Projection broadly corrupt or schema incompatible | versioned full rebuild and cutover |
| Authority data corrupted but valid backup/change log exists | restore/PITR plus downstream catch-up |
| Migration partially applied | forward repair using introspected state; rollback only if explicitly safe |
| Sink ahead of checkpoint | idempotent replay and checkpoint reconciliation |
| Checkpoint ahead of sink | rewind to proven receipt and replay |
| Authority unclear or independent writes conflict | stop mutation and require ownership decision |

Repair records should include incident, operator, input validation point, tool/version, commands, before/after counts/hashes, rejects, and remaining uncertainty.

## Failure-injection matrix

Inject process loss:

- before and after authority commit;
- after outbox/change insert;
- after sink write but before checkpoint;
- midway through artifact segment and before final manifest;
- during migration DDL/backfill;
- after queue lease and before acknowledgement;
- after wait/signal state change and before resume enqueue;
- during projection alias cutover;
- during shutdown with in-flight transaction/batch.

Inject dependency failures:

- timeout, connection reset, authentication failure, pool exhaustion;
- partial bulk rejection;
- malformed/corrupt input;
- disk full/permission denied;
- duplicate/out-of-order/late delivery;
- schema/config/version mismatch;
- stale authorization and privacy deletion.

Every test needs a post-restart oracle: authoritative identities, sink receipts, checkpoints, manifests, projection state, and operator-visible error.

## Verification and incident evidence

Verification must include the system handoff that failed:

- migration history plus PostgreSQL introspection and representative queries;
- artifact parser/full scan, schema, checksum, and manifest;
- search per-item receipts and identity reconciliation;
- graph input manifest, index version, representative SPARQL queries;
- ClickHouse system tables, convergence checks, and affected-range queries;
- complete cursor traversal under concurrent changes;
- restart/replay outcome and no skipped committed identities;
- privacy/tenant negative tests;
- process exit/open-handle check.

Keep failed/blocked/passed distinct. If a registry, engine, credential, or realistic data volume is unavailable, record the blocked proof and do not convert structural inspection into a passing operational result.

## Deliberate exclusions

- Do not immediately retry before preserving last committed evidence.
- Do not repair projections by editing them manually without recording authoritative reconciliation.
- Do not force a specific database, logger, validator, or Effect runtime.
- Do not label swallowed optional errors harmless without an explicit required/optional contract.
- Do not use counts alone when identity/content/version can differ.
- Do not claim recovery from a unit test that never restarts the process or real dependency.
- Do not treat a type-level ORM test as migration, concurrency, or lifecycle evidence.
- Do not expose raw queries, credentials, or personal data in incident output.

## Sources and freshness

Grounded in the retained finance PostgreSQL/Drizzle schema, migration guide, query utilities, workflow store/worker implementation, and PopModern importer, MediaWiki ETL, artifact utilities, Typesense, QLever, SPARQL, and ClickHouse infrastructure, reviewed 2026-07-17. Several signatures come from explicit prototypes or incomplete code paths, including swallowed ETL failures, materialized profiling/Parquet, placeholder search sink, non-atomic workflow transitions, and hidden pool lifetime. Revalidate behavior in the consumer's installed versions and deployed topology.
