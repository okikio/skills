# Site quality gates

Use this reference to define acceptance criteria for public sites and documentation. Quality is a set of observable route contracts, not a Lighthouse score or attractive screenshot.

## Quality inventory

For each route family record:

```text
Audience and user task:
Primary content/action:
Static/request-time/deferred rendering:
Canonical and index policy:
Required JavaScript/islands:
Images/fonts/icons/embeds:
CMS/API/auth dependencies:
No-JS behavior:
Failure fallback:
Performance budget:
Accessibility risks:
Privacy/security boundaries:
Deployment adapter and cache:
```

Use budgets tied to the route. A WebGL marketing hero, API reference, article, and authenticated settings page need different checks.

## Document and accessibility contract

Every page needs:

- correct `<html lang>` and unique, front-loaded title;
- one useful main landmark, restrained landmarks, and a skip link when repeated navigation exists;
- meaningful heading outline;
- link purpose that remains understandable out of context;
- native interactive elements where possible;
- visible focus and logical order;
- accessible names for icon-only controls;
- labeled forms, instructions, field errors, and submission status;
- image alternatives and decorative SVG/canvas removed from the accessibility tree;
- semantic tables and text/data alternatives for charts;
- usable zoom/reflow, contrast, forced colors, coarse pointer, and reduced motion;
- route announcement/focus behavior during client navigation.

Automated accessibility checks cannot validate focus strategy, announcement quality, alt usefulness, or whether a custom widget implements its keyboard contract. Inspect the accessibility tree and perform keyboard/screen-reader smoke tests.

Native HTML can eliminate entire defect classes. The Kaiju homepage's `<details>` FAQ is preferable to an unused hydrated accordion when ordinary disclosure semantics are sufficient.

## Content and discoverability

Validate from the actual mapped content model:

- page title, description, canonical, social card, and structured data;
- absolute production URLs with correct base path;
- sitemap, robots, feed, pagination, taxonomy, and archives;
- draft/preview/scheduled exclusion;
- canonical and redirects for migrated slugs;
- missing author/media/taxonomy and deleted content behavior;
- heading ids/table of contents stability;
- code/reference links and OpenAPI schema links;
- useful 404 and error pages.

Do not generate metadata independently in page, feed, and sitemap layers. A shared view model/policy should make them agree.

For API docs, diff generated OpenAPI and route catalogs. Ensure examples contain no real tokens, cookies, secrets, private hosts, or customer data.

## Performance budget

Measure the route rather than repeating generic advice:

| Resource/work | Evidence |
|---|---|
| HTML | Required content present before JS; reasonable size |
| JavaScript | Per-island chunks, duplicate renderer runtimes, unused islands |
| CSS | Critical styles, generated component layers, unused/global cost |
| Images | Intrinsic dimensions, responsive sources, format, priority, alt |
| Fonts | Critical faces only, subset/variants, preload, fallback metrics |
| Icons | Finite imports/collections; renderer/compiler match |
| Third parties | Origin, blocking cost, consent, failure isolation |
| Motion/WebGL | frames, long tasks, DPR/texture cap, background/offscreen suspension |
| DOM/rendering | large lists, `content-visibility`, layout/paint cost |

Track Core Web Vitals in representative conditions, but keep causal artifacts such as waterfalls, traces, bundle analysis, and long-task/frame evidence. A score alone does not identify ownership.

For `content-visibility: auto`, target large below-fold sections, pair with `contain-intrinsic-size`, and test keyboard accessibility. Do not apply it indiscriminately above the fold.

## Resilience and progressive enhancement

Test:

- JavaScript disabled or island chunk blocked;
- slow and failed images, fonts, icons, third-party embeds;
- no WebGL/context/texture and reduced motion;
- CMS/API timeout, invalid record, stale cache, and outage;
- repeated Astro client navigation, back/forward, and hash links;
- offline/static-asset caching if claimed;
- form/server validation when client validation is bypassed;
- preview/auth expiration;
- deployment cold start and missing binding/env;
- 404/500 and maintenance/error pages.

Progressive enhancement means the primary task has a defined baseline, not that every flourish works without JavaScript. State the baseline per route.

The Kaiju depth scene keeps a static image when WebGL initialization fails. This is the correct ownership shape for decorative enhancement: content and calls to action remain Astro HTML.

## Security and privacy

Verify:

- raw/rich content renderer against XSS payloads;
- public forms for CSRF/origin, rate/spam, validation, size, and duplicate policy;
- webhooks for raw-body signature, replay, idempotency, and redacted logs;
- CSP/resource origins, frame policy, referrer and permissions policy;
- external links, iframes, embeds, analytics, and consent;
- cache policy for preview/personalized pages;
- no secrets/PII in HTML, JS, metadata, URLs, generated docs, logs, or source maps.

Do not count obsolete `X-XSS-Protection` as modern XSS defense. Do not disable CSP because an integration was not inventoried.

## Visual and interaction quality

Inspect real content and states at multiple sizes:

- primary hierarchy and action remain clear;
- no clipping, overlay collision, layout shift, or horizontal page scroll;
- long titles, translated labels, large text, and missing media;
- focus, hover, pressed, selected, disabled, invalid, loading, and error states;
- sticky headers/rails and safe areas;
- readable line length and typography before/after font load;
- light/dark/forced-color consistency;
- reduced-motion replacement;
- touch target and coarse-pointer usability;
- visual fallback for canvas, image, and embed failure.

Do not use a Mermaid chart when a short sequence/table is clearer. Diagrams should clarify relationships, not decorate documentation.

## Deployment and operations

Verify the target adapter and host:

- build artifact and startup command;
- runtime version and APIs;
- environment/bindings and secret scope;
- static asset, image service, and media storage paths;
- redirects, headers, compression, cache/CDN behavior;
- server island and session support;
- canonical origin and preview domains;
- logs, correlation ids, error monitoring, and redaction;
- health/readiness behavior where applicable.

`astro dev` or a generic preview does not prove target-host behavior. Run an adapter-equivalent smoke or document the block.

## Verification matrix

1. Repository lint/type/content checks and Astro check.
2. Static/server production build and route/artifact inspection.
3. Link, canonical, feed, sitemap, robots, redirect, and OpenAPI validation.
4. Raw HTML/no-JS assertions and hydration diagnostics.
5. Browser keyboard, focus, accessibility-tree, zoom, responsive, touch, reduced-motion tests.
6. Screenshots for happy and failure states at narrow/desktop/stress sizes.
7. Bundle/waterfall/CWV/long-task/resource-lifetime evidence.
8. XSS, form, cache, auth/preview, webhook, and header checks.
9. CMS/API/media/WebGL/third-party failure injection.
10. Target-adapter startup and representative deployed request.

Report passed, failed, blocked, and not-run separately. Never translate a local build into a deployed, accessible, secure, or performant verdict without corresponding evidence.
