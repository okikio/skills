## Reactive ownership

Solid executes a component function once to create a reactive graph. It does not rerun the component on every state change. Preserve accessors and ownership:

| Need | Owner | Avoid |
|---|---|---|
| mutable scalar/local value | `createSignal` | mutable untracked local variable |
| derived value | `createMemo` or inline accessor | effect that writes another signal without need |
| list keyed by identity | `<For>` / keyed primitive when necessary | React-shaped `.map()` assumptions |
| index-keyed list | `<Index>` when values change but positions are stable | using it for reordered identity lists |
| conditional subtree | `<Show>`, `<Switch>/<Match>` | eager branch evaluation |
| async resource | resource/query owner selected from data semantics | duplicate signal plus fetch effect |
| external synchronization | `createEffect`/`onMount` with cleanup | effects as general computation |

Props are live access paths. Do not destructure reactive props casually:

```tsx
function Counter(props: { count: number }) {
  const doubled = createMemo(() => props.count * 2);
  return <output>{doubled()}</output>;
}
```

Use `splitProps`, `mergeProps`, or relevant `@solid-primitives/props` helpers when adapting component APIs. Verify which properties must remain getters.

## Components and control flow

Components own composition, not rerender cycles. Pass children with Solid's `children()` helper when access may need normalization or repeated evaluation. Avoid reading a conditional child before its owner branch exists.

For lists, make identity explicit. A data grid may need row IDs independent of page position. A keyed wrapper is useful only when the default control flow does not preserve the required reconciliation behavior.

Events use native event semantics. Prefer delegated JSX handlers for common bubbling events; use explicit event listeners when target, capture/passive options, or non-delegated events require them.

## Effects and external systems

Use effects for synchronization with APIs that exist outside Solid:

- DOM methods not expressible declaratively;
- storage/history synchronization;
- canvas/WebGL/animation runtime updates;
- subscriptions and external event sources;
- imperative third-party widgets.

Read dependencies intentionally. Use `on(...)` or `untrack(...)` only when the dependency contract demands it. A self-triggering effect usually indicates derived state or ownership is misplaced.

Every effect that starts a resource needs a teardown or a resource whose primitive registers teardown automatically.

## SSR and hydration

Server and first client render must agree. Guard browser globals, measurements, random values, current time, storage, media queries, and feature detection behind an SSR-aware primitive or mount boundary.

Do not create shared singleton state at module scope in SSR. It can leak one request's state into another. The uploaded Solid Primitives `rootless` package marks hydratable singleton behavior experimental; inspect the installed version before depending on it.

For viewport/media-dependent UI, render a deterministic usable default and enhance after hydration. Avoid hiding the entire page until `onMount` solely to silence a mismatch.

Test streaming SSR, direct navigation, client navigation, and repeated route mounting. Development mode may not reproduce production hydration ordering.

## Cleanup and roots

Solid ownership automatically disposes registered cleanup when a component/root goes away. It does not clean resources that were created outside the owner or never registered.

Dispose:

- listeners and observers;
- intervals/timeouts/idle callbacks;
- animation frames and motion values;
- `AbortController`s and network streams;
- WebSocket/SSE subscriptions;
- workers and message channels;
- external stores and observable subscriptions;
- retained subroots/singletons;
- result objects holding native resources.

`@solid-primitives/rootless` provides patterns such as `createDisposable`, `createSubRoot`, `createCallback`, and `createSingletonRoot`. Use them only when normal component ownership cannot represent the lifetime. `createDisposable` is appropriate for a resource that must stop before owner cleanup.

## Solid Primitives ecosystem map

The uploaded monorepo contains roughly eighty-five focused packages. Treat the repository as an ecosystem and search sibling packages before writing a new primitive.

| Concern | Candidate packages from uploaded source | Selection question |
|---|---|---|
| events | `event-listener`, `event-bus`, `event-dispatcher`, `event-props` | DOM target, single channel, typed multi-event, or prop adapter? |
| scheduling | `scheduled`, `raf`, `timer`, `idle` | debounce/throttle, one frame loop, timer, or idle work? |
| observers | `intersection-observer`, `mutation-observer`, `resize-observer` | what is the SSR default and cleanup owner? |
| environment | `media`, `page-visibility`, `connectivity`, `platform`, `devices`, `permission` | is the first render deterministic? |
| state/data | `resource`, `promise`, `storage`, `db-store`, `fetch`, `graphql`, `sse`, `websocket` | remote cache, stream, browser store, or one request? |
| composition | `props`, `refs`, `context`, `destructure`, `controlled-props`, `keyed` | preserve accessors and ownership? |
| collections | `list`, `map`, `set`, `pagination`, `virtual` | stable identity, pagination, or DOM bound? |
| roots | `rootless`, `lifecycle` | can normal owner cleanup work instead? |
| motion | `spring`, `tween`, `presence`, `transition-group` | lifecycle, interruption, SSR, and reduced motion? |
| browser capability | `clipboard`, `fullscreen`, `geolocation`, `filesystem`, `workers`, `broadcast-channel` | permission, failure, and server fallback? |

Package maturity badges matter. The uploaded `scheduled` and `rootless` docs show stage 2 while `event-listener` shows stage 3. Recheck the installed release; maturity can change independently per package.

## Selection procedure

For a candidate primitive:

1. search the monorepo package list and consuming lockfile;
2. inspect the package README, source exports, tests, maturity stage, and version;
3. distinguish `make*` non-reactive setup from `create*` reactive ownership;
4. identify server behavior and initial value;
5. identify owner cleanup and any manual early-dispose API;
6. inspect sibling packages required by the example;
7. test repeated mount/unmount and SSR;
8. import the smallest package, not the entire ecosystem.

Example event listener:

```tsx
import { createEventListener } from "@solid-primitives/event-listener";

let button!: HTMLButtonElement;
createEventListener(() => button, "click", handleClick, { passive: true });

return <button ref={button}>Run</button>;
```

The reactive `createEventListener` rebinds when reactive target/type changes and cleans up with the owner. In the uploaded 2.x documentation it does not return an early clear function; use an empty target/type or a disposable subroot when early removal is required. Do not copy the older return contract.

## Scheduling and global event coordination

The `scheduled` package provides cancellable `debounce`, `throttle`, idle scheduling, leading/trailing wrappers, and `createScheduled`. Timers clear on owner disposal.

```ts
import { debounce } from "@solid-primitives/scheduled";

const commitSearch = debounce((value: string) => navigate({ search: { q: value } }), 250);
onCleanup(() => commitSearch.clear());
```

For many pointer/scroll/animation consumers, prefer one shared requestAnimationFrame scheduler rather than one loop per component. Define registration, visibility pause, document-hidden pause, elapsed/delta clamping, reduced-motion policy, and last-subscriber teardown. Use `@solid-primitives/raf` only after verifying its API fits that singleton ownership.

EventBus is appropriate for hot one-to-many notifications. Do not replace routable URL state, remote query state, or durable workflow events with an in-memory bus.

## Motion and presence boundary

Treat the attached Solid motion package as experimental. The evidence notes incomplete gesture types and SSR/presence caveats. Use proven Solid Primitives or Web Animations/CSS where they satisfy the behavior. A type-compatible motion prototype is not production parity.

Presence must preserve exit lifetime, cancellation/interruption, nested ownership, focus, reduced motion, and deterministic server output. Verify rapid enter/exit toggles and route navigation.

## Failure signatures

| Signature | Likely defect | Correction |
|---|---|---|
| prop stops updating | reactive prop destructured | retain accessor or use Solid prop helper |
| effect loops | derived state modeled as effect | replace with memo/accessor |
| state leaks between SSR users | module singleton/root | request-local owner or hydratable verified primitive |
| listener count grows after navigation | created outside owner or missing cleanup | primitive/cleanup plus mount-count test |
| debounce fires after unmount | scheduler not owner-bound | clear/register cleanup |
| first paint flashes | browser value differs from SSR default | deterministic initial state and mount enhancement |
| wrong rows retain state | incorrect keyed/indexed control flow | choose stable identity owner |
| virtual list loses keyboard focus | mounted window owns focus incorrectly | focus retention/overscan/fallback |
| animation never exits | subtree removed before presence owner finishes | explicit presence lifecycle |

## Verification

- unit-test pure state and schema logic;
- use owner-root tests that dispose and assert listener/timer/subscription counts;
- SSR render and hydrate representative routes;
- navigate repeatedly and compare retained roots/resources;
- test document visibility, reduced motion, offline/permission failure;
- use fake timers only where they preserve scheduler semantics;
- test actual browser layout/observer/RAF behavior;
- run production build and inspect renderer/compiler output.

## Sources and freshness

- Primary: [Solid Primitives documentation](https://primitives.solidjs.community/), verified 2026-07-17 for the published ecosystem and package-level guidance.
- Attachments: `solid-primitives(2).zip` and `kaiju-site-scope(17).zip/apps/frontend`, inspected 2026-07-17 for package inventory, maturity stages, ownership, cleanup, SSR, scheduling, and consumer integration.

Individual primitive APIs and maturity stages are package-version-sensitive. Experimental or stage-listed packages are not stable merely because they appear in the monorepo; verify their package manifest, README, tests, and installed version.
