## Application contract inventory

Record before verification:

```text
Route tree and protected groups:
Validated params/search and defaults:
Loader dependencies and query factories:
Server functions/repositories and tenant scope:
Forms/mutations and idempotency:
Auth client/server/plugins/base paths:
Local/URL/query/session selection state:
Tables/virtualizers/charts:
SSR adapter and hydration:
Listeners/observers/frames/subscriptions:
Expected failures and safe targets:
```

Use fixtures and authorized local targets. Do not require production/shared mutations without permission.

## Route and URL oracles

For every route state:

- direct URL renders the same view as in-app navigation;
- reload preserves shareable filters, sort, page, and view;
- back/forward traverses intentional state changes;
- invalid search values parse to safe defaults or deliberate error;
- canonical defaults are stripped/preserved consistently;
- changing filter/query/sort/page-size resets dependent page;
- local dialog/selection/draft state does not pollute URL;
- protected route redirects preserve only allowlisted callback state;
- route error/not-found/pending states render distinct usable views.

Test the pure URL patch/reset functions and the actual router. A pure function passing does not prove browser history behavior.

## Query and server-function oracles

Assert:

- loader and component call the same query-options factory;
- key includes every result-changing input and server authority such as tenant;
- one SSR request gets a fresh request-scoped QueryClient where required;
- critical data is prefetched/streamed according to installed integration;
- stale time and invalidation match product freshness;
- initial pending differs from background refresh;
- server functions parse input again and derive authority from session;
- repository query enforces tenant/base filters;
- public errors are stable and diagnostics are redacted;
- abort/cancellation/reordered results cannot overwrite current state.

Instrumentation can fail tests on duplicate equivalent fetches or unexpected query keys.

## Form and mutation oracles

Test:

- label/autocomplete/description/error association;
- keyboard submit and button type;
- touched/blur/submit validation timing;
- client bypass and server validation;
- slow/reordered async validation;
- double submit, retry, idempotency, and unique conflict;
- navigation/close during pending work;
- expired session/forbidden/conflict/rate-limit/network/500;
- field/form error mapping and focus/announcement;
- optimistic snapshot, rollback, authoritative response, and exact invalidation;
- provider/social/passkey pending paths do not overlap.

Verify committed domain state at the server/repository, not only a success toast.

## Auth and tenant oracles

- importing client auth code requires no server secrets;
- server/client plugin and framework binding match;
- issuer/base URL, handler mount, discovery, callbacks, cookies, and trusted origins agree;
- allowed origin can send credentialed request; rejected origin cannot read it;
- unauthenticated, expired, revoked, and wrong-role sessions behave correctly;
- organization switch updates server authority, query keys, cached data, and UI;
- user cannot query/mutate another organization by changing URL/body/header;
- personalized routes are private/no-store as designed;
- logout/session invalidation clears protected state.

Test authorization at repository/service APIs. A route redirect and hidden button are insufficient.

## Data-view and virtualization oracles

- stable sorting with deterministic tie-breaker;
- filter/facet/count semantics under combinations;
- pagination edges after insert/delete;
- selected id remains the same record across sort/refresh;
- selection scope (page/ids/all-matching) matches bulk request;
- server reauthorizes every bulk target;
- table caption/headers/sort state and keyboard focus;
- responsive overflow/card alternative and zoom;
- virtualizer stable keys, measurement, overscan, scroll container, pinned rows, resize, and dynamic height;
- focused row policy when outside rendered range;
- SSR initial virtual range/hydration and scroll restoration;
- infinite load prevents duplicates/repeated calls and handles reordered pages;
- empty/loading/stale/partial/error/completed states remain distinct.

Run with realistic row counts and variable content lengths. A ten-row fixture does not prove virtualization.

## SSR, hydration, and lifetime

For representative routes:

1. Capture raw server HTML and initial serialized state.
2. Assert required content/styles before hydration.
3. Hydrate while capturing mismatch diagnostics.
4. Interact before/after hydration where possible.
5. Navigate/mount/unmount repeatedly.
6. Assert listener, observer, timer, frame, subscription, animation, WebGL, and retained-owner counts return to baseline.

Cover media/storage preferences, random/time/locale, auth capabilities, query dehydration, invalid HTML, client-only fallbacks, portals, and persisted islands.

## Accessibility, security, and performance

Accessibility:

- landmarks/headings/route announcement;
- keyboard/focus in dialogs, sheets, menus, grids, virtual lists;
- accessible field/status/error semantics;
- table/chart alternatives;
- zoom/reflow/contrast/forced colors/reduced motion/touch.

Security:

- client bundle/HTML/source maps contain no secrets;
- raw/rich content XSS tests;
- CSRF/origin/cookie/CORS tests;
- redirect allowlist;
- cross-tenant tests;
- cache headers and redacted logs/errors.

Performance:

- route JS/CSS and duplicate framework packages;
- loader waterfalls/query duplication;
- hydration/interaction timing;
- large table DOM/virtualization/memory;
- long tasks and continuous work;
- font/icon/image output;
- navigation memory/resource trend.

## Failure matrix

| Handoff | Required cases |
|---|---|
| URL/router | malformed, defaults, reload, back/forward, unknown route |
| Query | slow, stale, offline, abort, reordered, invalid response |
| Server function | invalid input, unauthenticated, forbidden, conflict, rate limit, 500 |
| Form | invalid/corrected, duplicate, pending navigation, server field error |
| Auth | expired/revoked session, bad origin/callback, organization switch |
| Table | empty, huge, sort ties, delete current page, resize, long content |
| Virtualizer | wrong estimate, dynamic height, focus off-range, fetch failure |
| Renderer | server mismatch, chunk failure, portal/theme mismatch |
| Resources | listener/frame/subscription leak, background/offscreen work |
| Deployment | missing env/binding, cold start, wrong base URL/cookie |

Every case needs an observable oracle: response/status, DOM/accessibility state, cache key, repository result, resource count, or artifact. “No exception” is too weak.

## Evidence report

```text
Passed
- exact check and contract proved

Failed
- observed signature and owning component

Blocked
- missing target/credential/authority/runtime and remaining risk

Not run
- deliberate exclusions

Artifacts
- route traces, network logs, screenshots, accessibility output,
  hydration diagnostics, bundle report, resource counters
```

Do not claim cross-browser, deployed, accessibility, security, or performance success from unit/type/build evidence alone.
