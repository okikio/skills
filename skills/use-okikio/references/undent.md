## When to load this reference

Load this reference for readable multiline literals, generated source, SQL or
GraphQL snippets, CLI help, snapshots, nested code generation, interpolation
alignment, line-ending preservation, or terminal-width-sensitive output.

Do not load it merely because a repository depends on `@okikio/undent`.

## Evidence and version boundary

The reviewed source is `@okikio/undent` `0.3.3`. It exposes the root module and
an opt-in `@okikio/undent/unicode` entry point. Verify the installed version and
export map before copying an exact import or relying on implementation details.

The package solves source indentation and interpolation layout. It is not a
general code formatter, terminal table engine, escaping system, SQL builder, or
security boundary.

## Capability model

The root API separates five decisions that shallow usage often conflates:

1. which indentation is structural;
2. which blank wrapper lines are removed;
3. whether source line endings are preserved or normalized;
4. whether interpolated multiline values are aligned;
5. how the insertion column is measured.

The important exports in the reviewed version are:

| Capability | Export |
|---|---|
| Default tagged-template processor | `undent` |
| Alias for the default processor | `dedent` |
| Classic outdent-compatible policy | `outdent` |
| Build an independent configured tag | `createUndent()` |
| Process a runtime string | `undent.string()` or `dedentString()` |
| Align an interpolation without dedenting it | `align()` |
| Dedent and then align an interpolation | `embed()` |
| Set an explicit indentation baseline | `undent.indent` or `indent` |
| Recognize an alignment wrapper | `isAligned()` |
| Resolve configuration | `resolveOptions()` |
| Low-level line operations | `splitLines()`, `rejoinLines()`, `alignText()` |
| Raw insertion-column measurement | `columnOffset()` |
| Visual terminal measurement | `createUnicodeColumnOffset()` and related `./unicode` exports |

Prefer the high-level tag, factory, and wrapper functions. Low-level exports
are useful for integration or conformance work, but reassembling the algorithm
from them creates more surface for semantic drift.

## Choose the API by intent

### A readable static literal

```ts
import { undent } from "@okikio/undent";

const query = undent`
  SELECT account_id, sum(amount) AS total
  FROM ledger_entries
  WHERE posted_at >= {start:DateTime64}
  GROUP BY account_id
`;
```

This strips source-code indentation. It does not validate or parameterize SQL.

### A runtime-loaded string

```ts
const source = await Deno.readTextFile("template.sql");
const normalizedIndent = undent.string(source);
```

Use `.string()` rather than pretending a dynamic value is a template segment.

### A multiline value that is already left-aligned

```ts
import { align, undent } from "@okikio/undent";

const items = "- inspect\n- plan\n- verify";

const result = undent`
  phases:
    ${align(items)}
`;
```

`align()` stringifies the value and pads later lines to the insertion column.
It does not remove indentation already present inside the value.

### A snippet with baked-in indentation

```ts
import { embed, undent } from "@okikio/undent";

const fragment = `
    SELECT id
    FROM users
`;

const result = undent`
  query:
    ${embed(fragment)}
`;
```

`embed()` first applies the package's string dedent behavior and then aligns the
result. This is the correct distinction when snippets originate in separately
indented constants or files.

## Indent detection and trimming

`UndentOptions.strategy` controls the structural baseline:

- `"common"` scans content lines and strips the smallest shared indentation;
- `"first"` uses the first content line as the reference and matches the
  package's documented classic `outdent` behavior.

The default is `"common"`. Do not select `"first"` only because it sounds
faster: it changes semantics when later lines are less indented.

`trim` accepts one policy for both ends or separate leading and trailing
policies. Each side supports:

- `"all"`: remove all edge blank lines;
- `"one"`: remove at most one edge blank line;
- `"none"`: preserve wrapper lines.

```ts
const preserveLeading = undent.with({
  trim: { leading: "none", trailing: "all" },
});
```

Whitespace-sensitive formats need exact-string tests for the selected policy.
A snapshot that visually hides the first or last blank line is insufficient.

## Interpolation and alignment

Alignment is opt-in by wrapper, or global per configured instance through
`alignValues: true`.

```ts
const generator = undent.with({ alignValues: true });

generator`
  command:
    ${"first line\nsecond line"}
`;
```

Prefer explicit `align()` or `embed()` when only selected values need layout
treatment. Global alignment is useful for a dedicated generator, but can alter
unrelated interpolations and should not be enabled casually on a shared helper.

Interpolation is stringification, not syntax-aware composition. Values still
need the correct escaping or parameterization for their destination:

- SQL values belong in driver parameters;
- HTML values belong behind the renderer's escaping contract;
- shell arguments belong in argument arrays rather than generated command text;
- source identifiers require language-specific validation.

Internal caches used for repeated embedded snippets are bounded performance
details. They neither sanitize content nor guarantee a cache hit.

## Explicit indentation anchors

Use `${undent.indent}` as the first interpolation on its own line when a code
generator needs a deliberate baseline instead of inferred common indentation.

```ts
function emitFunction(name: string): string {
  return undent`
    ${undent.indent}
    export function ${name}() {
      return true;
    }
  `;
}
```

Content at the anchor column becomes column zero; deeper content preserves its
relative offset. The anchor is a layout instruction, not emitted text.

Use it when nesting depth in the implementation must not change generated
output. Avoid it when normal common-indent detection already states the intent.

## Line-ending ownership

The default `newline: null` preserves `LF`, `CRLF`, and lone `CR` sequences in
template segments. Set `newline: "\n"` only when the output contract requires
normalization.

```ts
const portableGeneratedText = undent.with({ newline: "\n" });
```

Newlines inside interpolated values are not rewritten by the template-segment
normalization option. Normalize dynamic snippets separately if the whole output
must use one convention.

This distinction matters for golden files, generated source, protocol payloads,
and repositories that preserve platform-native endings.

## Unicode and terminal columns

The root `columnOffset()` counts raw JavaScript string units after the final
newline. That is deterministic for source layout but not equivalent to display
columns for tabs, combining marks, CJK characters, or emoji.

The `./unicode` entry point supplies terminal-oriented measurement:

```ts
import { undent } from "@okikio/undent";
import {
  createUnicodeColumnOffset,
} from "@okikio/undent/unicode";

const terminalText = undent.with({
  alignValues: true,
  columnOffset: createUnicodeColumnOffset({
    tabWidth: 4,
    ambiguous: "narrow",
  }),
});
```

The reviewed Unicode options are:

- `tabWidth: false | positive integer`; `false` treats a tab as one column,
  while an integer advances to tab stops;
- `ambiguous: "narrow" | "wide"` for East Asian ambiguous-width code points;
- `widthOf(grapheme, state)` to override individual grapheme widths and return
  `undefined` for the default behavior.

`visualColumnWidth()` walks grapheme clusters and uses best-effort terminal
rules. Renderers can still disagree. The target terminal, font, locale, and
tab policy own the final visual result, so include real display fixtures where
column alignment is user-visible.

## Configured instances

`.with()` derives a new immutable instance from the current instance's resolved
settings; `createUndent()` begins from package defaults.

```ts
const base = undent.with({ newline: "\n" });
const exactFixture = base.with({ trim: "none" });

const classic = createUndent({
  strategy: "first",
  trim: "one",
});
```

Use dedicated instances for distinct output contracts rather than scattering
per-call policy choices. Good names describe the destination, such as
`generatedSource`, `terminalHelp`, or `snapshotText`.

`dedent` is an alias of `undent`. `outdent` is not an alias: in the reviewed
version it is preconfigured with `strategy: "first"` and `trim: "one"`.

## Integration patterns

### Generated source

- use an explicit anchor if implementation nesting must not affect output;
- normalize newlines only when the generated-artifact contract says so;
- use the target language's formatter after generation when canonical syntax
  layout is required;
- compile or parse the generated artifact in verification.

### CLI help and diagnostics

- use `embed()` for separately authored blocks;
- use Unicode column measurement only for terminal-column alignment;
- keep stable machine output independent of decorative alignment;
- verify narrow widths, redirected output, no-color mode, and Unicode samples.

### SQL, GraphQL, and configuration snippets

- use `undent` for readable static structure;
- keep values parameterized;
- treat indentation cleanup and query safety as separate boundaries;
- execute representative syntax through the real parser or database in tests.

### Snapshots

- select trim and newline semantics explicitly;
- compare exact strings including invisible edges;
- avoid a project-wide helper whose implicit policy makes fixtures ambiguous.

## Incorrect patterns

Do not:

- use `align()` when the value first needs dedenting;
- claim `embed()` escapes or validates the embedded language;
- assume default column measurement matches terminal width;
- normalize template-segment newlines and claim interpolation newlines changed;
- use `outdent` as if it were a name-only alias;
- depend on undocumented cache sizes or eviction order;
- convert every one-line literal into an `undent` template;
- format generated code visually without parsing, compiling, or executing it.

## Failure signatures

| Symptom | Likely cause | Next inspection |
|---|---|---|
| Second interpolation line jumps to column zero | Value was not wrapped and `alignValues` is false | Inspect `align()`, `embed()`, or configured instance ownership |
| Embedded block remains over-indented | Used `align()` for a snippet with baked-in indent | Replace with `embed()` and add exact output test |
| Significant leading blank line disappears | Default trim policy removed it | Set per-side trim explicitly |
| Mixed CRLF/LF output remains | Only template segments were normalized | Inspect interpolated values and whole-artifact policy |
| CJK or emoji causes visual drift | Raw string-unit column measurement | Use the Unicode entry point with target policy |
| Tabs align differently across terminals | Tab stops or renderer differ | Pin `tabWidth` and verify on supported terminals |
| Generated SQL is injectable | Layout helper was mistaken for query construction | Restore driver parameters or a query AST |
| Refactor changes generated indentation | Inferred baseline moved with source nesting | Introduce an explicit anchor where appropriate |

## Verification

Use table-driven exact-string tests covering:

- empty strings and blank-only input;
- common versus first-line strategy;
- all, one, and no trimming on each edge;
- nested `align()` and `embed()` interpolation;
- explicit anchors at multiple source nesting levels;
- `LF`, `CRLF`, and lone `CR` preservation and normalization;
- dynamic interpolations containing their own line endings;
- tabs, emoji, CJK, combining marks, zero-width marks, and ambiguous-width text;
- custom `widthOf()` and invalid width/tab configurations;
- generated output parsed, compiled, or executed by the destination system.

Verify behavior, not just importability. A strong check asserts the exact output
and then passes that output through the consumer whose contract it must satisfy.
