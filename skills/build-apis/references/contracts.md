## Contract layers

Keep these layers distinct and traceable:

```text
wire bytes / URL / headers
  -> source-specific transport parser
  -> runtime schema validation
  -> normalized application input
  -> domain capability
  -> domain result or typed failure
  -> HTTP response variant
  -> OpenAPI operation and generated client expectations
```

The schema nearest the wire owns wire syntax. A domain schema owns domain
meaning. They can share fragments, but do not pretend a query-string boolean and
a JSON boolean have the same input representation.

## Zod and Standard Schema ownership

Use Zod v4 schemas as the source of truth where the repository has selected Zod,
then infer types with `z.input`, `z.output`, or the repository's helpers:

```ts
export const CreateImportJson = z.object({
  upload_id: z.uuid(),
  mapping: z.record(z.string(), z.string()),
})

export type CreateImportJsonInput = z.input<typeof CreateImportJson>
export type CreateImportJson = z.output<typeof CreateImportJson>
```

Input and output types differ when a schema coerces, defaults, transforms, or
brands. Choose deliberately.

Use Standard Schema at a validator-neutral library API:

```ts
export async function validateWith<TSchema extends StandardSchemaV1>(
  schema: TSchema,
  input: StandardSchemaV1.InferInput<TSchema>,
): Promise<StandardSchemaV1.InferOutput<TSchema>> {
  const result = await schema["~standard"].validate(input)
  if (result.issues) throw new BoundaryValidationError(result.issues)
  return result.value
}
```

Do not rewrite application schemas in multiple validators to prove neutrality.
Test the reusable utility against representative Zod and one other Standard
Schema implementation only when multi-validator support is a real requirement.

## Request sources

Define separate schemas for each source read by the handler:

| Source | Wire concerns | Common traps |
|---|---|---|
| Path params | Percent decoding, non-empty identifiers | Treating untrusted ID as authorization scope |
| Query | Repeated keys, strings, empty values, ordering | Boolean/number coercion and ignored unknown keys |
| Headers | Case-insensitive names, combined/repeated values | Expecting original casing after normalization |
| Cookies | Name/value restrictions, signing, scope | Treating client cookie as trusted session data |
| JSON | Content type, size, finite values, unknown fields | Parsing twice or accepting non-JSON content |
| Form/multipart | Repeated fields, files, limits, streaming | Buffering an unbounded upload |

Register matching middleware before reading a validated Hono source:

```ts
export const Middleware = [
  createValidator("param", Definition.schemas.Param),
  createValidator("query", Definition.schemas.Query),
  createValidator("json", Definition.schemas.Json),
]

const params = c.req.valid("param")
const query = c.req.valid("query")
const body = c.req.valid("json")
```

An endpoint definition alone does not populate `c.req.valid(...)`.

## Normalization and coercion

Normalize only after source-aware validation. Make absence, empty string, false,
zero, repeated values, and invalid values observably different where the API
contract needs them.

```ts
export const ListQuery = z.object({
  limit: z.string().regex(/^\d+$/).transform(Number).pipe(z.int().min(1).max(200)).default("50"),
  cursor: z.string().min(1).optional(),
  include_archived: z.enum(["true", "false"]).transform((value) => value === "true").default("false"),
})
```

This is an example, not a universal coercion policy. If a query parser supplies
arrays for repeated keys, decide whether to reject or support them before the
transform. Do not let JavaScript's `Boolean("false")` or permissive `Number("")`
define the public API.

Use `.strict()`, `.passthrough()`, or explicit catchalls according to forward
compatibility and security needs. Security-sensitive command inputs usually
benefit from rejecting unknown fields; metadata bags may intentionally retain
them.

## Response and problem contracts

Model complete response variants, not the payload alone:

```ts
const Responses = {
  202: {
    contentType: "application/json",
    schema: AcceptedImport,
    headers: z.object({ location: z.string().url() }),
  },
  401: problem("unauthorized"),
  403: problem("forbidden"),
  409: problem("idempotency-conflict"),
  422: validationProblem,
} as const
```

Use an RFC 9457-style problem registry with stable types/codes and safe public
detail. A problem should carry enough stable information for a client decision:

```json
{
  "type": "https://api.example.test/problems/idempotency-conflict",
  "title": "Idempotency key conflict",
  "status": 409,
  "detail": "The key was already used for a different request.",
  "instance": "/imports",
  "code": "idempotency_conflict",
  "correlation_id": "req_..."
}
```

Do not include SQL, filesystem, provider, stack, secret, or raw validation input
in a public problem. Preserve the original cause in redacted diagnostics.

For validation problems, retain source and path:

```json
{
  "code": "validation_failed",
  "errors": [
    {
      "source": "json",
      "path": ["mapping", "email"],
      "location": "json.mapping.email",
      "message": "Expected a column name"
    }
  ]
}
```

## OpenAPI completeness

OpenAPI is derived from the runtime definition registry or checked against it.
For each operation declare:

- stable `operationId`, method, path, tags, summary, and description;
- path/query/header/cookie parameters with required and repeated semantics;
- every request body content type and schema;
- every success, empty, redirect, accepted, validation, auth, conflict,
  rate-limit, and known domain-error response;
- response headers such as `Location`, `Retry-After`, cursor, ETag, or rate limit;
- auth/security schemes and per-operation requirements;
- examples that validate;
- deprecation and version information;
- streaming media type and event schema where applicable.

For accepted durable work, document status, cancellation, and event-stream links.
For cursor endpoints, document cursor opacity and invalid/expired behavior.

OpenAPI compatibility checks should distinguish:

| Change | Typical classification |
|---|---|
| Remove operation or response field | Breaking |
| Make optional request field required | Breaking |
| Narrow enum accepted by server | Breaking |
| Add optional response field | Usually compatible, but strict clients can fail |
| Add error response | Behaviorally significant; document and test |
| Change operation ID | Client-generation breaking |
| Change default/sort/cursor semantics | Semantic breaking even if schema unchanged |

## Contract evolution

Version behavior, not just shapes. Keep a compatibility window between deployed
clients, API hosts, workers, and migrations. Use additive evolution where
possible and explicit version negotiation where semantics cannot remain
compatible.

Do not embed a service implementation version into every route automatically.
Choose URL, header, media-type, or capability versioning according to external
consumer needs. Internal APIs still need deployment-order compatibility.

For events and workflow inputs, retain schemas/decoders for in-flight historical
versions or migrate durable records explicitly. An API host can accept a request
under a new schema while an older worker remains responsible for the run.

## Testing and verification

- Parse valid/invalid values for every request source.
- Assert handler non-execution after validation failure.
- Verify unknown-key, repeated-key, empty-value, coercion, content-type, and size
  behavior.
- Parse every actual success and problem response with its declared schema.
- Assert headers and empty responses, not only bodies.
- Verify safe causes and redaction with hostile provider/SQL error strings.
- Compare declared, registered, documented, and request-tested operation sets.
- Run OpenAPI lint and breaking-change checks against the released baseline.
- Generate a client and execute at least one representative request when client
  generation is promised.
- Replay stored workflow/event inputs against compatible decoders.

## Failure signatures

| Signature | Cause | Correction |
|---|---|---|
| `c.req.valid()` is empty | Validator middleware absent/wrong source | Pair schemas and route middleware |
| Type compiles but runtime returns string | `z.input`/`z.output` confusion or missing transform | Test parsed output |
| Client cannot handle actual response | Payload-only schema | Declare full variants/status/headers |
| OpenAPI route returns 404 | Generator catalog differs from runtime registry | One registry plus reachability test |
| Validation returns 500 | Transform threw outside normalized validation stage | Normalize schema and thrown validator errors |
| Cross-org ID passes schema | Validation mistaken for authorization | Server-owned policy after identity |
| Generated client breaks after “additive” change | Strict decoder or operation ID drift | Compatibility test the real client |
| Raw SQL appears in problem detail | Cause copied to public response | Stable problem and redacted diagnostic |
